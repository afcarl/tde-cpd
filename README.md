#About 
I am currently working on my master's thesis under the supervision 
of Professor Doina Precup in the Reasoning and Learning Laboratory.

Reinforcement learning has proven to be a powerful approach for solving 
many sequential decision making problems. Robotics lends itself also quite
naturally to RL which considers the process of acquiring knowledge through 
the interaction of an agent with its environment. My research goal is to 
create RL-based systems that could leverage the knowledge of a robot teacher
through demonstrations. More precisely, I'm interested in the problem of
 hierchical subtask decompositions from demonstrations for options learning.

Given a demonstration, we would want an RL agent to find meaningful subtask
boundaries and learn a corresponding consistent set of options.
