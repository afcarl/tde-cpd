This dataset comes from: 

Learning and Inferring Motion Patterns using Parametric Segmental Switching Linear Dynamic Systems 
Sang Min Oh, James M. Rehg, Tucker Balch, Frank Dellaert
International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) Special Issue on Learning for Vision, May 2008. Vol.77(1-3). Pages 103-124.

We simplified the original .btf format to a simple 3-columns .dat.

These were obtained by executing:
$ paste ximage.btf yimage.btf label0.btf > sequence1.btf
